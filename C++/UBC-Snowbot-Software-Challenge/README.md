# Snowbots Software Challenge

Welcome to the Snowbots Software Challenge! 

- This challenge is in C++. To get started, simply clone this repository and open `main.cpp` in an editor of your choice. 
- If you're not familiar with C++, we've included a file called `CMakeLists.txt` that our IDE of choice (CLion) can use as a project file, so just download CLion and open it ("File" -> "Import Project")!
- The code _should_ compile on any platform (Windows, OSX, Linux), but if not, please let us know and we'll get it sorted out!
- Once you're finished the challenge, shoot us an email with your solution (`snowbots.ubc@gmail.com`)
